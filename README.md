# HurdleDive

Hurdle Dive is a simple run & jump game for Android, and iOS.  The game's core mechanic is that you can tap the jump button again to dive to the ground, which allows you to jump more quickly.  As the game progresses you're given much less space in between hurles, and diving becomes a necessity. 

The game is writen so that as long as you dive at the correct time, you shouldn't hit a hurdle.  When the player hits a hurdle the game is over.  The goal of the game is to achieve the furthest distance.
